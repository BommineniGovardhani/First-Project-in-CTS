/* Sita wanted to celebrate the good news 
of her promotion. She took her niece Mahirl along 
with her and went to Fun Mall to meet her close friend Gita.
 Gita was busy with her customers and she asked her to wait for 
an hour. Mahirl grew restless sitting idle. So Sita took her 
around the Mall. A competition for kids was going on in the 1st 
floor. They were given 'n' fancy sticks in different colors of 2 cm 
length and they were asked to form the largest square possible. Many 
kids were playing with the fancy sticks. Mahirl always likes colorful
 sticks and she also wanted to take part in the competition. But the
 organisers told that the competition is open only for kids above 10 
years. Mahirl started crying and they allowed her to participate in
 the contest. They asked to Sita to give her instructions. But Sita 
should not touch any of the sticks. Sita has good reasoning skills 
and she was wondering what could be the area of the largest square 
that can be formed using 'n' sticks. Can you help Sita out and help 
Mahirl in winning the prize?
