<p>
Bhogi is the first day of the four-day Makarsankranti festival. 
According to the Gregorian calendar it is normally celebrated on 13 January. 
It is a festival celebrated widely in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and.
Telangana.On Bhogi, people discard old and derelict things and concentrate 
on new things causing change or transformation. At dawn, people light a bonfire
 with logs of wood, other solid-fuels and wooden furniture at home that are no longer useful.
 The disposal of derelict things is where all old habits, vices, attachment to relations 
and material things are sacrificed in the sacrificial fire of the knowledge of Rudra, known as
 the "Rudra Gita Jnana Yajna". It represents realization, transformation and purification 
of the soul by imbibing and inculcating various divine virtues.

On Bhogi day, ladies people shower dairy animals manure and water before house 
and draw rangoli muggulu. On Muggu rangoli, gobbemmalu are kept. Gobbemma is a
 bovine excrement ball, brightened with pasupu turmeric, kumkum, and blooms. 
The significant legend of Bhogi is related with the celestial marriage of 
Godadevi and Sri Ranganatha swamy. This day likewise denotes the finish of Dhanurmasam. 
Vishnu puja is considered as exceptionally promising amid Bhogi. According to another 
legend, Bhogi is the most loved day for Ruler Indra thus Indra puja is likewise performed in a few spots.

When all are gathered, let your baby or child sit on the chair facing East. 
Apply kumkuma on your babies forehead and gandham i.e chandanam on the neck. T
ake a handful of 'bhogi pallu', turn it over the head of the child first in 
clockwise and then anti-clockwise direction and then place / pour these on the child's head.

All the elderly ladies can hold the harati pallem and can sing harati
